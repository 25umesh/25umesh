## 🌟 About Me

I’m **Pagadoju Umesh**, a passionate Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my **B.Tech (3rd Year)** at  
**Methodist College of Engineering and Technology**.

💻 I build **web and Android applications**, taking projects from concept to deployment with a focus on clean architecture, usability, and purposeful design. I enjoy solving real-world problems using modern technologies and crafting end-to-end solutions that feel polished and meaningful.

🎥 Outside of development, I explore the creative world through **video editing, photography, and cinematography**. These fields shaped my sense of style, composition, and flow—skills that naturally influence how I design and build digital experiences.

📹 I previously built a YouTube channel with **1k+ subscribers**, grown entirely through original content before it was lost due to technical issues.  
That journey strengthened my abilities in:

- audience engagement  
- creative direction  
- editing and storytelling  
- consistency and content strategy  

🧠 With a strong interest in creativity and narrative thinking, I aim to create products where **technology, design, and storytelling converge**—building experiences that not only function well, but also *feel crafted*.
